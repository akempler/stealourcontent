# StealOurContent

This module makes a "Republish" button available via the block system. 
The button will be displayed on node pages and when clicked, a modal will be 
displayed allowing users to copy the relevant content of the node along with 
additional appended information such as a link back to the originating node, 
author information, and tracking capabilities to record view counts and 
referrer information.
